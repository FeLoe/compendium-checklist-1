1,Q1.1,,,First_time_user,Is it the first time you are working with Version Control?,Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.,Yes,img/yes.svg,"Ever produced a text document, script or datafile with a title looking like this: <em>""FinalVersion2.0_REVISITED18may_FL""</em>?</br> Click on more information to learn how to organize your scripts in a reproducible, open, and transparent manner.",Git_next,No,img/info.svg,"I know version control and have worked with it before. </br> </br> If you want to (re)visit or look up some principles of working with version control, A you can find a comprehensive documentation <a href=""https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/"" target=""_blank""> here</a>.",Git_next,Version control,"When working on vast, collaborative scientific projects, keeping track of different versions of your work can be a burden. Still, it is important to store older versions - not only because you might want to revert changes later on in the process, but also because you want to get insight into what changes your coworkers made to your precious file. <br/> Luckily, there now exist digital version control systems, that make version control easy and understandable. Such version control systems save not only new files that you save to the system, but also the changes between the old and new version. This way, you can easily keep track of changes and revert to old versions (or even combine different ""branches"" of a file) as you please.  <br/> Right now, the most popular software amongst scientists for doing this is Git, a prrogram that manages ""repositories"" (the ""folder"" with your project), which stores files and each file's revision history. <a href=""https://github.com/"" target=""_blank""> Github.com </a> is an cloud web server which offers the opportunity to store your repository remotely, to easily collabore on projects with colleagues.

You can find more information on what that is and how to do it here (https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Recording-Changes-to-the-Repository) and here (https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Viewing-the-Commit-History).

If you work together in a team, you also should commit early and often (see above), but you additionally also need to take care of managing a project or even an orgainzation. That way you make sure that the work of everyone gets organized the right way and you can all collaborate on one folder structure.

3,Q3.3,,,Encryption,Do you want to encrypt your data?,Explanation,Yes,img/yes.svg,I want to encrypt my data.,Data_type,No,img/info.svg,I do not want to encrypt my data.,Data_type,Encryption,"Data encryption translates data into another form, or code, so that only people with access to a secret key (formally called a decryption key) or password can read it. Encrypted data is commonly referred to as ciphertext, while unencrypted data is called plaintext. Currently, encryption is one of the most popular and effective data security methods used by organizations. (source (https://digitalguardian.com/blog/what-data-encryption)). 

Your data should be encrypted if it is not possible to share your data openly, either because it is proprietary or because it includes sensitive information that cannot be made public as plain text. If you are not sure about matters of encryption and what data need to be encrypted, you should first consult the ethical board of your research institution.

There are many different forms of raw data - the important thing is that it has not been through any form of processing yet. It is crucial to preserve the raw data of your project if possible. 

Processed data is raw data that was modified by certain forms of data cleaning and processing such as dealing with missing values, making scales, aggregating data etc. 

In a research compendium, you should put the raw data in the ""raw"" folder (possibly encrypted) (MORE INFO NEEDED HERE)"

This is very common for example for R or Python. Sometimes, however, you will need your own specialized functions to deal with your data or do analyses. It is then important to preserve the code that you used in the compendium so that other researchers can re-run your analyses and adapt them where necessary."
